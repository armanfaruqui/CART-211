          <br> <br> <h1> What Am I? </h1>
          <p> To put it simply, just a kid who was born in Karachi, Pakistan, but was raised on the internet. I spent way more time than I should have doing things like finding new music, playing different video games, binging anime, and researching the most random information and topics. (Did you know that squid brains are doughnut shaped, and their esophagus runs through it. If a squid eats something too big it can get brain damage). It took me way longer than it should have to realize that what I love doing can be my lifestyle if I just start trying to create the things that I enjoy putting time into. I dropped my high school additional mathematics course to take media studies. After I made a short film and music video, I found my passion for creativity and collaboration. From there I applied to Concordia to specialize in Computation Arts, and here I am presenting the first website I have made to the class. Or I was just created 5 minutes ago with fake memories, and I would not be able to prove otherwise.
