<h3>As We May .<span> Think </span> </h3>

<p1> "As We May Think" is a fitting title for this article which reflects on humanity’s history with information and technology,whilst also prospecting on where we have yet to take it. Bush begins by discussing the great strides mankind has taken, to survive and thrive, since the dawn of their existence. This portion examines the many hurdles scientists and engineers have had to overcome to create certain inventions. It puts into perspective the complexities of these creations which most humans in this day and age take for granted. Most people nowadays do not appreciate the generations of dreaming, planning and innovation that it took to create something as common as a television screen. The fact that this planet’s greatest minds would fantasize about inventions which we barely bat an eye at now opened my mind regarding the endless possibilities we as a civilization can achieve next. <br> <br>

The focus then shifts more towards information processing. It becomes clear that our progression as a species is dependent on how much we are able to record, learn and understand about the human experience. This article came out at a time where this fantasy was on the verge of becoming the reality that it is today. Newly emerging compression technology such as microfilm and dry photography was the foundation for Bush’s optimism. In 1945, compression was important simply for the sake of preserving information.  Even today one of the most common aspects of technological advancement is about compression. Each IPhone released is thinner and lighter, and comes with more features and capabilities. All codes/programmes are constantly tried to be made shorter and more efficient so they can be transferred faster and be run on a wider range of devices. <br> <br>

 Bush’s hypothesis of the ‘memex’ is by far the most interesting part to me. The image he creates of a device which can be used to record, index, and access information strongly resembles what a modern computer system does today. This is especially impressive when I realized that transistors were not even invented at the time of this article's release. But what piqued my interest even more was how different the two systems actually function. From the perspective of someone living in the 21st century, one could find Bush’s hypothesizing amusing for how tedious his ideas may seem. The use of buttons, levers, and screens built into the desk makes it seem like a tool out of an old school science-fiction. Whilst the core concept of this device exists today in almost any computer, the vision he had for how the device functions as part of the table is something that I believe can become popular with devices invented in the near future. </p1>



<h3> From Counterculture to .<span> Cyberculture </span> </h3>


<p1> The internet has always somewhat played the role of a parent for me. Through it I have discovered multiple pieces of art that I deeply connect with, obscure facts and information that I would not have known otherwise, and even friends that I would not have met without it. Before reading this article, I never truly understood the historical and cultural significance behind this network I access every day. What I found most fascinating is despite how most of it was new information to me, reading it felt like I understood something I always knew. </p1>
<p1> The excerpt from this book about counterculture and cyberculture provides an account on the non governmental institutions which poured their life’s effort and imagination into the conception of computers and the internet. The way the researchers and engineers from prestigious institutions such as Stanford came together with the computer hobbyists, who can also be defined as ‘hippies’, gives the reader an understanding of how much energy was put into their endeavours. Despite how both groups of people may seem like polar walks of life, their common goal of improving communication and the evolution of the human consciousness brought them together. </p1>
<p1> Before the work of these groups, the use of computers were limited to military, industrial and academic purposes. Terminology with connotations which do not appeal to me at all. The researchers and hobbyists worked to shift the focus towards more creative, personalized, and communication based ideas. They aimed to achieve a “man computer symbiosis” which would eventually go on to lead the evolution of the human conscious. Having access to so much information and news in this day and age has made it so that finding an individual with unique interests, aspirations and understandings is no longer a near impossible feat. Most of us are aware about pressing social issues, and have a platform to learn and communicate about their history, current affairs, and possible solutions. </p1>
<p1> The cultural significance behind this movement was extremely fascinating to learn about. Whilst hippies are often praised for their ideologies, they are stereotyped as people who focus on their own pleasure as opposed to contributing to society. Their culture which focused on creativity, unity in diversity, and individuality was materialized through their focus on the personalization of computers. We often ignore the significance of the ‘P’ in PC. Personalization was a driving force in counterculture which represented these humans being free from dominant conformative forces of those in power. I particularly found the comparison between LSD and video games captivating. Both provide a platform where we are free from thinking and behaving in a way that we have been conditioned to. Both present the user with a new reality where we become more in touch with our primal instincts rather than our trained behaviours. </p1>

<h3> Inter<span>net Art </span></h3>
<p1> This week's readings take a dive into the history, culture, and movement of net art. Both articles place an emphasis on the importance of the ‘community’ various new users of the internet would form. The connectivity that the internet provided allowed for users to share their work to a wider audience faster than ever before. Net artists were constantly being inspired by work shared by other net artists, and hence were able to learn new and different ideas quickly in a short span of time. Whilst these communities placed importance on maintaining their own style, culture, and philosophies, it was not long until the larger corporations and industries would start paying interest into these rapidly growing online communities. Websites built by users would begin to be bought by large companies such as AOL, whilst multimedia artists such as Shu Lea Chang would be hired to design websites for the Guggenheim. Whilst some may consider the fast commercialization of net art to be disappointing, I find it important especially when considering how the ARTnews article touched upon how difficult it can be to monetize content uploaded on the internet due to how easily it can be shared. </p1>

<p1> One aspect of net art that both articles touched upon which I found particularly enjoyable was the general focus on making net art ‘fun’. The social media narrative ‘Dorm Daze’ presents something which can almost be described as a new age sitcom. Creating multiple fake accounts to build a collective narrative is so simple in essence. Something you may expect from a group of bored teenagers. However, this is what makes the captivating and realistic nature of this work so impressive. Rachele Greene’s also goes over how the earliest forms of pharming were done to pull pranks by taking users to parody websites, rather than to collect sensitive information or cause actual harm. </p1>

<p1> I also thoroughly enjoyed reading about the unique wave of feminism which took place during the earlier periods of net art culture. The over the top “Cyberfeminist Manifesto” provided a space for female net artists to come together in a space where they were free to express themselves in ways which I would imagine being difficult in more ‘normal’ social gatherings. Anne de Haan’s e manifesto of “The Vagina is the Boss on the Internet” may sound strange, yet stands true to this day with a good portion of content uploaded on the internet being related to straight porn, and with a good portion of chat room users being raunchy desperate straight males. </p1>
