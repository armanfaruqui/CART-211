<h1> CART 211 Week 1 Exercise
</h1>
<p1> "As We May Think" is a fitting title for this article which reflects on humanity’s history with information and technology, whilst also prospecting on where we have yet to take it. Bush begins by discussing the great strides mankind has taken, to survive and thrive, since the dawn of their existence. This portion examines the many hurdles scientists and engineers have had to overcome to create certain inventions. It puts into perspective the complexities of these creations which most humans in this day and age take for granted. Most people nowadays do not appreciate the generations of dreaming, planning and innovation that it took to create something as common as a television screen. The fact that this planet’s greatest minds would fantasize about inventions which we barely bat an eye at now opened my mind regarding the endless possibilities we as a civilization can achieve next. </p1> <br> <br>

<p2> The focus then shifts more towards information processing. It becomes clear that our progression as a species is dependent on how much we are able to record, learn and understand about the human experience. This article came out at a time where this fantasy was on the verge of becoming the reality that it is today. Newly emerging compression technology such as microfilm and dry photography was the foundation for Bush’s optimism. In 1945, compression was important simply for the sake of preserving information. I find the empahsis that Bush places on the importance of these techonolgies impressive considering which decade he was talking about it in. Even today one of the most common aspects of technological advancement is about compression. Each IPhone released is thinner and lighter, and comes with more features and capabilities. All codes/programmes are constantly tried to be made shorter and more efficient so they can be transferred faster and be run on a wider range of devices. </p2> <br> <br>

<p3> Bush’s hypothesis of the ‘memex’ is by far the most appealing part of the essay to me. The image he creates of a device which can be used to record, index, and access information strongly resembles what a modern computer system does today. This is especially impressive when I realized that transistors were not even invented at the time of this article's release. But what piqued my interest even more was how different the two systems actually function. From the perspective of someone living in the 21st century, one could find Bush’s hypothesizing amusing for how tedious his ideas may seem. The use of buttons, levers, and screens built into the desk makes it seem like a tool out of an old school science-fiction. Whilst the core concept of this device exists today in almost any computer, the vision he had for how the device functions as part of the table is something that I believe can become popular with devices invented in the near future. </p3>
